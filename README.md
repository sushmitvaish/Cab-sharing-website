# Cab-sharing-website

The project is to implement security to a Cab Sharing Website, for facilitating riding and hailing of a cab by customers to get from one location to another. The goal is to make an intuitive User Interface and a robust backend to protect the integrity of the users and drivers, in order to provide a safe and comfortable journey. To make the site secure we will use some Web Security functionalities such as implementing password security, managing SQL Injection, etc. We have also used Web Hosting to host this website on a server so that it can be accessed anytime from anywhere in the world.
